Today is November 23, 2025, and the time of writing is 20:53 MST.

Just found out that my LotC application was denied because I practically had nothing on the application, but thats fine. My character needed a rework anyways.
On the topic of LotC, I saw a lot a places while spectating, and even saw an event in (I think) Norland's capital.

Starting to do more pushups than normal. My record so far is 15 in a row. Hoping to increase that to 20 by next week.

However, I spent a lot of time staring at a screen, so I'm going to install a screen time limiting extension to prevent me from looking at my laptop for more than 3 hours a day.

Today went by fast, so there isn't much more to say.

The closing time is 20:58 MST.
