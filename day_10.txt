Today is December 3, 2025,  and the time is 22:21 MST

We won our game against the Trojans today, and we're really happy about, since it's the first game of the season.
  We also have a tournament on Friday, and I hope we can dominate that one as well.

My younger brother is pressuring me to write today's entry, so I need to write as fast as possible.

Just got the Graceful Ghost Rag printed off. Will start working on that ASAP.

My younger brother is going to shut the Wi-Fi off, so I'll have to cut it off here.

The closing time is 22:25 MST
