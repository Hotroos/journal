The date is November 29, 2025, and the start time is 20:31 MST.

I've really been slacking lately, with keeping track of everything that goes around me every day.
But honestly, I'm starting to stop caring about anything, because I have no motivation.
All the self-help and motivational videos on YouTube can't help me here.
But let's focus on something else for now.

I attended a piano masterclass today for one of my piano pieces, Old Adam by William Bolcom. Apparently he's still alive. Wish I could meet him. He's brilliant.
I did better in this masterclass than I did while I was warming up at home. 
  We then went to go eat at a Chinese buffet. It was really good.

Thinking about the masterclass reminds me of the party I had last night at my school. It's the first school party in it's entire history, if I'm correct.
I participated in some group dances, like the Virginia Reel, and we also did the Cha-Cha slide. I don't think I'll forget a party like this one.

Today, I finally had the highest ADR on my team in CS2. It was achieved in casual, but still proud of it. It was 127.

I've finally decided on the military as my future occupation, most likely as a paramedic or somewhere in combat operations.

Weather's gotten pretty cold, and we've got a lot of snow in our small town. Despite this, the sky was crystal clear today, and just seeing how beautiful the moon was made me tear up.

This should be it today. I really am getting more text in each entry.

The closing time is 20:47 MST.
