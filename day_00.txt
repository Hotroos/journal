Today is November 22, 2025, and the time of writing is 20:34 MST.

This is the day that I create this journal. And to start this off, I'll just mind dump what I have in mind.

Today was the last day in volleyball zones, and we placed 5th. This isn't so bad, we usually place dead last in the league and zones.

I played competitively on Dust II in CS2, and we ended up in a tie. I placed dead last as usual, but I'm still learning. I only have 50 hours at this time, anyways.

I need to start locking in this year, Grade 10, because it's one of the last three years in high school, and one of the three years that affect my placement in university.

I won't say much anymore, it's getting late, and my mum's getting mad at me.

The closing time of this journal is 20:41, MST.
