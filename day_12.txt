Today is December 5, 2025, and the timme is 21:18 MST.

Today was my mum's birthday, according to the Lunar calander. To celebrate, I grabs some prizes from a bingo event that happened tonight and gace her half my shares.

  This bingo event is huge in my area, and the gym is always filled to its maximum capacity. It's real fun

  I'm listening to this while writing this entry:

  I usually listen to this type of music when I'm alone, because it's just really soothing, especially after a long day.
  Speaking of long days, we played against a really tough team in basketball today, but we somehow beat them 84-81. It was in a tournament, in the double bracket style, too.
  We managed to move to the winning half, while they moved to the losing half. Shame.

  Life really is just passing by.

  Our team plays at 10:15 MST tomorrow. Hope we win this one.

  The closing time is 21:27 MST.
