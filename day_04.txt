I failed to write last day's journal, so that's why that day is missing. I'll try and keep better track.
However, because of this, I created a reminder to write in this journal everyday using Todoist.

I had a ELA quiz today about poetry vocabulary, and I think I did decently well on it.

I've been thinking about my efforts in life towards a successful and stable life, and I kind of gave up on just thinking about it, which isn't really a good sign. I really need to
start dedicating more time into this. I also need to minimize time on my laptop.

Also while I'm writing this, my younger brother barged in, so I had to switch away while he was here. Not gonna lie, I'm slightly scared of him.

My school has this winter dance coming this Friday, and I'm asking my dad to get me some flowers so I can ask a girl out in my class. Hopefully it goes well.

I could've done a bit better in basketball, because my coach only plays the best on the team, and I want to prove to him that I'm capable to play.

I also need to do better on my piano if I want to compete in the Lethbridge Music Festival. The only reason I won last time was because there was only one other competitor.
There's bound to be more competition this year.

Speaking which of music, my piano teacher bought a book full of William Bolcom's Rags for me, so I can't let that go to waste.

I CS2 today, I got a 3k with an AWP in casual within a few seconds, which I'm proud of. I still placed close to the bottom.

This is the longest journal I've written yet, and hopfully I can be consistant with this length.

The end time of this entry is 20:44 MST.
