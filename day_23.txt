...I'm really depressed rn.

I had to break up with a "friend" that I've had for some time.
The truth was, I never really liked her the same way she liked me.
But I lied to keep her happy.
This has been wearing me down for too long.
I can't do this anymore
And I can't forgive myself for doing so
But I'll go insane if I keep holding on.

I'm sorry.

On the bright side, we did win a basketball game today. and I actually got a point for once. Yay.

The ending time is 23:00 MST
