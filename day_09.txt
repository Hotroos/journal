The day is December 2, 2025, and the start time is 21:14 MST.

I think spacing out the journal entries might be a good idea because I like challenging my memory.

Just had piano lessons today, and during the lesson, her dad apparently had a heart attack. Hope he's okay.

I have about two weeks until it's Christmas break! Honestly, can't wait for that. Leetify released the testing version of Operation Unearthed, and I had a real hard time trying to solve a certian puzzle. Still trying to solve it.

I'm in the bathroom right now, because my parents don't want to see me on my laptop.

We got our first game of the season tomorrow for basketball, against the Trojains.
  I kinda want to put the town name in, but I feel like it'd give too much information about me

Anyways, time passes too fast for any events to be eventful.

See you next time.

The ending time is 21:23 MST.
