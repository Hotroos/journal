The day is December 11, 2025, and the staring time is 21:07 MST.

I swear I'm getting slower by the day.  Or the day passes too quick. Because I feel like nothing is achievable anymore. It's becoming hard to maintain skills everyday, and life is just sucking right now
Fortunately, I've gone through periods like this before, so I do my best to stay calm and keep moving until the worst blows over.

I have a stack of assignments to finish from school, but I purposfully didn't bring them home, because I a giant procrastinator. I'm just being lazy. Nothing is fixing that.
But I also need to change my mindset. That's why I'm thinking all of this right now. 2/3 of me wants to ignore everyting I think about. The other 1/3 want me to change.

I need to finish this.


My school is hosting a tournament tomorrow and Saturday. However, due to some stupid reason, we have a 4A school participating. This tournament consists of only 1A schools. We're so screwed.

Whatever. Not like I'm gonna make a difference. I'm the bench warmer. Barely get any playing time. But it's probably for the best. I'm not the best in basketball.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ -- Gotta have to change this mindset. Gotta start listening to more energetic music to hype me up.

  Hope you guys have a great day.

The end time is 21:17 MST
