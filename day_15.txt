Today is December 8, 2025, and the start time is 19:29 MST

I had to double-check the starting time on this, because I thought baskeball practise went so much later.
On the topic of basketball practise, I ran my butt off today, and I'm proud of myself for actually trying to improve.

Missed the last 2-3 days to exhaustion. Hope I can get more sleep.

I was super stressed over school today, because I thought I had 5 diiferent assignments to hand in, but after checking through, I only had three. Major relief.

Last night, I found a banger called Citadel by BoomKitty. I imagined a few animations that could use this song. If only I was skilled enough to actually animate.

I'm just mind-dumping stuff here as I go. Hope you guys don't mind.

Nothing too memorable in the past two days, unless you count the fact that our team placed third in the tournament over the weekend.

I think I'll stop there. I've got assignments to finish anyways.

The ending time is 19:36 MST.
